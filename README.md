# CourseCreator
## Project aim
CourseCreator is a web app that help educators quickly transfer existing knowledge to digital format and share it with students. At this stage, the resources are lesson module and quiz module. 

- Quiz module has a quiz builder for quiz, questions and answers.
- Lesson module contains text, multimedia (e.g., image and videos) and reference link to external resources.

To create content on the website, we use a Trix text editor that is natively integrated into ActionText module of Ruby on Rails version 6.

## Challenges
- Embedding videos using Trix editor
- Nested form at 3-level depth for building quiz with multiple questions and answers
