# CourseCreator
This project is created and maintained by a team of 3, [@HarshilSiyani](https://github.com/HarshilSiyani), [@zachchung](https://github.com/zachchung) and [@erik-trantt](https://github.com/erik-trantt)(me). This repo is a fork from the [original repo](https://github.com/HarshilSiyani/CourseCreator) that contains additional work on code refactoring and UI/UX optimization.

## Project aim
CourseCreator is a web app that help educators quickly transfer existing knowledge to digital format and share it with students. At this stage, the resources are lesson module and quiz module. 

- Quiz module has a quiz builder for quiz, questions and answers.
- Lesson module contains text, multimedia (e.g., image and videos) and reference link to external resources.

To create content on the website, we use a Trix text editor that is natively integrated into ActionText module of Ruby on Rails version 6.

## Challenges
1. Embedding videos using Trix editor
1. Nested form at 3-level depth for building quiz with multiple questions and answers

**WIP**
Sections to work on next addition:
